# Replay

**Your Video Universe, Simplified**

## Overview

Replay is a GNOME application currently in development, aimed at simplifying
your video-watching experience by allowing you to aggregate multiple video
sources into one unified platform. While Replay is still in its early stages and
currently features a blank window, I have exciting plans for its future!

## Vision

Replay will enable users to:

- **Add Multiple Video Sources via Plugins**: Integrate platforms like YouTube,
  Odysee, PeerTube, and more through a flexible plugin system.
- **Local Data Storage**: Enjoy a local-first approach where all your data
  remains on your device, ensuring privacy and security.
- **Unified Search**: Search across all added video sources with ease.
- **Local History & Playlists**: Keep track of your viewing history and create
  custom playlists.
- **User Following**: Follow your favorite content creators across different
  platforms.

## Current Status

As of now, Replay is a blank window, laying the groundwork for future features.
I am actively working on the following:

- Implementing the core functionality for the plugin system to add video sources.
- Developing the user interface for a seamless experience.
- Designing the local history and playlist features.
